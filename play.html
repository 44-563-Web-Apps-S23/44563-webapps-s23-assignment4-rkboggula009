        TRADITION[B]<br>
        
            <br>
             SCENE: _The sitting-room at the_ OLLIVANTS' _in a small town
             up-State. It is an evening late in the spring._<br>
        
             _A simple room is disclosed, bearing the traces of another
             generation. Old-fashioned window-doors at the right, overlooking
             the garden, open on a porch; another door in back opening on the
             hall-way. A large fire-place at the left, now concealed by an
             embroidered screen; the horsehair furniture, several terra-cotta
             statuettes, and a woodcut or two on the walls create the subtle
             atmosphere of the past. There is a lamp on the table, and another
             on a bracket by the door in back. Moonlight filters through the
             window-doors._<br>
            <br>
             _The_ OLLIVANTS _are discovered together_. MARY, _a rather plain
             woman of about twenty-five, with a suggestion of quick
             sensibilities, is standing, lost in thought, looking out into the
             garden. Her mother_, EMILY, _nearing fifty, quiet and subdued in
             manner, is seated at the table trimming a hat. Occasionally she
             looks at_ MARY, _stops her work, glances at her husband, closes her
             eyes as though tired, and then resumes. The silence continues for
             some time, broken only by the rattle of the town paper which_
             GEORGE OLLIVANT _is reading. He is well on in middle life, with a
             strong, determined face not entirely without elements of kindness
             and deep feeling. When he finishes, he folds the paper, puts it on
             the table, knocks the ashes carefully from his pipe into his hand,
             and throws them behind the screen; takes off his spectacles and
             wipes them as he, too, looks over toward his daughter, still gazing
             absently into the garden. Finally, after a slight hesitation, he
             goes to her and puts his arm about her; she is startled but smiles
             sweetly._<br>
            <br>     
            OLLIVANT. [_Affectionately._] Glad to be home again, Mary?<br>
        
            MARY. [_Evasively._] The garden is so pretty.<br>
        
            OLLIVANT. Hasn't changed much, eh?<br>
        
            MARY. It seems different; perhaps it's the night.<br>
        
            OLLIVANT. I guess it isn't up to its usual standard. Haven't seen your
            mother there so often this spring.<br>
        
            EMILY. [_Quietly._] This dry spell is not good for flowers.<br>
        
            OLLIVANT. It's only the cultivated flowers that need care; can't help
            thinking that when I see the wild ones so hardy in my fields on the
            hill. [_Turning to_ EMILY _and patting her_.] Is there any of that spray
            mixture left, Emily, dear?<br>
