    <p>GEORGE MIDDLETON

        George Middleton, one of the first to write and publish a volume of
        one-act plays in America, was born in Paterson, New Jersey, 1880. He was
        graduated from Columbia University in 1902. Since 1921 he has been
        literary editor of _La Follette's Weekly_, and, in addition, has been a
        frequent contributor to magazines and reviews on dramatic and literary
        subjects. During the last few years he has spent much of his time
        abroad.
        
        George Middleton's chiefest interest has been in the one-act play. He
        has been an ardent champion of the shorter form of drama. Among his
        three volumes of one-act plays are _Embers_ (including _The Failures_,
        _The Gargoyle_, _In His House_, _Madonna_, and _The Man Masterful_),
        _Tradition_ (including _On Bail_, _Their Wife_, _Waiting_, _The Cheat of
        Pity_, and _Mothers_), and _Possession_ (including _The Grove_, _A Good
        Woman_, _The Black Tie_, _Circles_, and _The Unborn_). Other one-act
        plays are _Criminals_ and _The Reason_. His longer plays are _Nowadays_
        and _The Road Together_. Mr. Middleton has lectured widely on the
        one-act play before colleges, in Little Theatres, and clubs. Perhaps his
        most notable article is _The Neglected One-Act Play_, which appeared in
        _The New York Dramatic Mirror_ in 1912.
        
        _Tradition_ is one of Mr. Middleton's best and most popular one-act
        plays; and it most nearly conforms to the organic technic of the one-act
        play.
        
        FIRST PERFORMANCE AT THE BERKELEY THEATRE, NEW YORK CITY, JANUARY 24,

        THE PEOPLE
        
        GEORGE OLLIVANT             MR. GEORGE W. WILSON
        
        EMILY, _his wife_      MISS ALICE LEIGH
        
        MARY, _his daughter, an actress_      MISS FOLA LA FOLLETTE
        
        
        
        
        TRADITION[B]
        
        
             SCENE: _The sitting-room at the_ OLLIVANTS' _in a small town
             up-State. It is an evening late in the spring._
        
             _A simple room is disclosed, bearing the traces of another
             generation. Old-fashioned window-doors at the right, overlooking
             the garden, open on a porch; another door in back opening on the
             hall-way. A large fire-place at the left, now concealed by an
             embroidered screen; the horsehair furniture, several terra-cotta
             statuettes, and a woodcut or two on the walls create the subtle
             atmosphere of the past. There is a lamp on the table, and another
             on a bracket by the door in back. Moonlight filters through the
             window-doors._
        
             _The_ OLLIVANTS _are discovered together_. MARY, _a rather plain
             woman of about twenty-five, with a suggestion of quick
             sensibilities, is standing, lost in thought, looking out into the
             garden. Her mother_, EMILY, _nearing fifty, quiet and subdued in
             manner, is seated at the table trimming a hat. Occasionally she
             looks at_ MARY, _stops her work, glances at her husband, closes her
             eyes as though tired, and then resumes. The silence continues for
             some time, broken only by the rattle of the town paper which_
             GEORGE OLLIVANT _is reading. He is well on in middle life, with a
             strong, determined face not entirely without elements of kindness
             and deep feeling. When he finishes, he folds the paper, puts it on
             the table, knocks the ashes carefully from his pipe into his hand,
             and throws them behind the screen; takes off his spectacles and
             wipes them as he, too, looks over toward his daughter, still gazing
             absently into the garden. Finally, after a slight hesitation, he
             goes to her and puts his arm about her; she is startled but smiles
             sweetly._
        
            OLLIVANT. [_Affectionately._] Glad to be home again, Mary?
        
            MARY. [_Evasively._] The garden is so pretty.
        
            OLLIVANT. Hasn't changed much, eh?
        
            MARY. It seems different; perhaps it's the night.
        
            OLLIVANT. I guess it isn't up to its usual standard. Haven't seen your
            mother there so often this spring.
        
            EMILY. [_Quietly._] This dry spell is not good for flowers.
        
            OLLIVANT. It's only the cultivated flowers that need care; can't help
            thinking that when I see the wild ones so hardy in my fields on the
            hill. [_Turning to_ EMILY _and patting her_.] Is there any of that spray
            mixture left, Emily, dear?
