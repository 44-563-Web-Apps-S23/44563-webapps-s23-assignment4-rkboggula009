        <h4>TRADITION[B]</h4>
        
            <br>
             SCENE: _The sitting-room at the_ OLLIVANTS' _in a small town
             up-State. It is an evening late in the spring._<br>
        
             <p>_A simple room is disclosed, bearing the traces of another
                generation. Old-fashioned window-doors at the right, overlooking
                the garden, open on a porch; another door in back opening on the
                hall-way. A large fire-place at the left, now concealed by an
                embroidered screen; the horsehair furniture, several terra-cotta
                statuettes, and a woodcut or two on the walls create the subtle
                atmosphere of the past. There is a lamp on the table, and another
                on a bracket by the door in back. Moonlight filters through the
                window-doors._</p>
             <p>_The_ OLLIVANTS _are discovered together_. MARY, _a rather plain
                woman of about twenty-five, with a suggestion of quick
                sensibilities, is standing, lost in thought, looking out into the
                garden. Her mother_, EMILY, _nearing fifty, quiet and subdued in
                manner, is seated at the table trimming a hat. Occasionally she
                looks at_ MARY, _stops her work, glances at her husband, closes her
                eyes as though tired, and then resumes. The silence continues for
                some time, broken only by the rattle of the town paper which_
                GEORGE OLLIVANT _is reading. He is well on in middle life, with a
                strong, determined face not entirely without elements of kindness
                and deep feeling. When he finishes, he folds the paper, puts it on
                the table, knocks the ashes carefully from his pipe into his hand,
                and throws them behind the screen; takes off his spectacles and
                wipes them as he, too, looks over toward his daughter, still gazing
                absently into the garden. Finally, after a slight hesitation, he
                goes to her and puts his arm about her; she is startled but smiles
                sweetly._</p>

            hill.

            <p class="speech">Is there any of that spray
            mixture left, Emily, dear?</p>
